                    <p>Hi, I’m Lizi Eloshvili! I’m from Georgia and currently work at TBC Bank. I’ve always been fascinated by international relations, politics, and national security, and I studied political science at Caucasus University. I even had the chance to spend some time in the Netherlands through the Erasmus+ program—so yes, I’m definitely a bit of a globe-trotter at heart.</p>

                    <p>Outside of work, I have a ton of passions that keep me busy and inspired. I love skiing down snowy slopes, enjoying delicious sushi, getting lost in a good book, or binge-watching my favorite anime. I’m also learning French, which has been a fun and sometimes challenging adventure! One of my favorite hobbies is making lists of everything—movies, books, travel plans, you name it—it helps me stay organized and focused on my goals.</p>

                    <p>Traveling is one of my biggest joys, and I love exploring new countries and cultures. I recently went to Thailand and completely fell in love with its beautiful nature, vibrant culture, and amazing food. I also enjoy sharing my adventures and daily life on social media—Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat (where my friends and I have a huge collection of “streak” images we send each other constantly).</p>

                    <p>I’m naturally curious, a little adventurous, and love discovering new things wherever I go. Whether it’s tackling a challenging project at work, hunting down the most delicious sushi roll, or planning my next big trip, I like to approach life with energy, enthusiasm, and a sense of fun.</p>

                    <p>In short, I’m someone who loves learning, exploring, connecting with people, and enjoying all the little and big adventures that life has to offer.</p>
